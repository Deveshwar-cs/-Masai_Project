# -Masai_Project
This is my first MASAI Project
# Banking System

## Project Description
This is a console-based Banking System implemented in Python. It allows users to create and manage accounts, perform banking transactions, and securely log in to their accounts. All user data and transaction history are stored persistently using file handling.

## Features Implemented
1. **Account Creation**:
   - Create new accounts with a unique account number, name, password, and initial deposit.
   - Store account details in `accounts.txt`.

2. **Secure Login**:
   - Validate account number and password for secure access.

3. **User Dashboard**:
   - View account balance.
   - Deposit money.
   - Withdraw money (with sufficient balance checks).
   - View transaction history.
   - Change account password.
   - Close account permanently.
   - Logout option.

4. **Transaction Logging**:
   - Logs all deposits and withdrawals with date and time in `transactions.txt`.

5. **Persistent Storage**:
   - User account details and transaction logs are stored and managed using file handling.

## How to Run the Project
1. Save the project script (e.g., `banking_system.py`) in your desired directory.
2. Ensure you have Python installed (Python 3.6 or later recommended).
3. Place `accounts.txt` and `transactions.txt` in the same directory as the script (they will be created automatically if not present).
4. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python banking_system.py
   ```

## Installation Instructions
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.6 or later. [Download Python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   If hosted on a platform like GitHub, clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   Execute the program using:
   ```bash
   python banking_system.py
   ```

## Additional Notes
- The project is entirely console-based and does not require external libraries.
- Ensure `accounts.txt` and `transactions.txt` have proper write permissions.
- Follow the prompts on the screen to navigate through the system.

Enjoy using the Banking System! Feel free to suggest additional features or improvements.
